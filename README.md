360+x: A Panoptic Multi-modal Scene Understanding Dataset - Project Page
Welcome to our project page.

Getting Started
To begin exploring our project, we recommend starting with the index.html file. This serves as the main project page and provides an overview of our work.

More Examples
For a deeper dive into our project, we have included a range of additional examples. These are accessible in two ways:

Through the Main Project Page: At the end of the index.html page, you'll find a section titled "More Examples." Clicking on the images or links in this section will redirect you to more_example.html.
Direct Access: Alternatively, you can directly open the more_example.html file in a web browser to explore the additional examples straight away.
